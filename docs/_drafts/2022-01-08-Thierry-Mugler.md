<p style="font-size:18px">Bustier: made in collaboration with corset designer Mr. Pearl. (The models were <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/george-michael-supermodels-linda-evangelista">not paid</a> as the video was made to raise money for AIDS research.) Not George Michael's first iconic music video: "Freedom! '90" 1998 song also full of supermodel appearances.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the owner of the corset since 2001, <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/82449">contextualizes the bustier</a>: "The citing of motorcycle imagery for a bustier melds the concepts of chassis and the female torso. The implication of the body as a vehicle to be driven or ridden inevitably raises the possibility of sexist interpretation. On the runway, however, the model, gripping her handlebar panniers, steered herself."
An <a href="https://fashionhistory.fitnyc.edu/1992-thierry-mugler-bustier/">analysis</a> by the <i>Fashion History Timeline</i>, a project by FIT's Art History Department, concludes with:
"It was lauded as cheeky and extravagant by the fashion community during its debut and has been celebrated since as art in its own right. The iconic bustier will be remembered of some of Mugler’s finest work."
1992 S/S collection, throughout which a western theme was evident (sci-fi as well), as inspired by his own motorcycle riding, </p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Mugler himself has declared that "the Mugler woman is a winner who is in command of her look and her life. She is free and sure of herself." The commercial availability of elastane fabrics that enabled figure-hugging designs led to Mugler's adoption of latex and vinyl, materials of the fetish and underground scenes. (Recently, most notably Casey Cadwallader's Mugler Spring 2020 Ready-to-Wear.) Beyond erotic maximization, self-awareness was asserted with body consciousness. In an interview with the couturier that was published in <i>The New York Times</i> in 1994, the American art historian and feminist Linda Nochlin summarized his style with: "It's so extreme that these women aren't sex objects, they're sex subjects."</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">With a background in classical dance, he had a flair for dramatic runway shows, a notion highly suggested by his use of structured, extreme, sometimes evocative silhouettes. His work was fantastical, very much unlike the commercial fashion that is prevalent today. Models would even be told to act more theatrically. The campiness of this collection was no different. Mugler’s characters were superhuman. No one’s just mediocre, it’s all about superhumans: the thinnest and the tallest and the most extreme and the most beautiful. But [it is also about] adoring the human form, not making fun of women or males. Mugler loves the form and he loves to push how far it can go. A true appreciation for the human form, represented. For many, he celebrated the strength to the human form, particularly that of a woman's, and  </p>transformed ordinary women and supermodels alike into otherworldly and astonishing creatures with the help of PVC and a penchant for showmanship. He transformed women into space-age vixens on the regular and created whimsical and quite often erotic clothing fantasies. A fan of extremes, in the appreciation of the human form, the casting of the models, the silhouettes he used

“He made everyone look like a superhero or a supervillain. I’ve always been drawn to strong women and for me, nobody celebrated strong women as Mugler did. When I started doing drag I looked to his designs immediately. The colour palette was always there in my looks and there was 1980s and 1990s nostalgia when I came to create the character of Detox. Everything at the beginning was very severe – I was much more of a club kid but all the pieces I wore were super angular. There was a lot of fetishwear, corsetry and vinyl. Anything that was slick, shiny and tight I was all about. Which is obviously very Mugler.”

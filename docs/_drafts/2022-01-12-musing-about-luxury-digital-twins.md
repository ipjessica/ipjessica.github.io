title: Musing about Luxury Digital Twins (on Lukso and Arianee)
---

<p style="font-size:18px">What is the point of NFT-based certificates to authenticate luxury goods, for instance, if the provenance of the certificate cannot necessarily be verified</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Arianee, a protocol that runs on the Lukso network, is well-known in the digital space of luxury goods, particularly given the fact that they have advisors(??) who are working at traditional luxury houses. Arianee has a mobile application that acts as a digital wallet, on which you can buy, sell and trade any items (NFTs) you wish - as long as they are "issued by verified brand," meaning issued by a brand that are part of their network. This proved to be an issue when I had the idea of wanting to intearct with their smart contracts in order to mint an item of my own and see if it would appear on my wallet. Given all of the talk of open-source and decentralization in web3, there seem to be quite a number of barriers to get to that transparency.</p>

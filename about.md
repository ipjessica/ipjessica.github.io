<h4>Interdisciplinary Technologist, Autodidact</h4>
<img src="/assets/images/9.jpg" alt="headshot" width="200" height="40"/>
<p>As a technologist who has cultivated interests across various disciplines that I find intellectually stimulating, the throughline has been seeking a human-centric element in the interactions we have with technology, whether that is "technology" in its classic definition, or technology that is more interwoven with our lives without conscious awareness: the technology of infrastructure, of textiles, of culture. A sideline to that throughline is that I believe there is always nuance and one must take great care to interpret every discussion through the lens of nuance. I am passionate about solving problems using my innate curiosity and desire for growth by applying in-depth research, critical thinking, and creativity in a highly intentional manner to understand comprehensively the areas that interest me:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fashion - sustainability, supply chain management</li>
    <li>Technology - distributed/decentralized computing, high performance computing, cryptography</li>
    <li>Textiles - biomaterials, materials science</li>
    <li>Computational Theory of Mind (i.e., the role of philosophy in computer science)</li>
    <li>History</li>
    <li>Photography - film, editorials, black & white</li>
    <li>Computational Thinking</li>
    <li>Philosophy</li>
    <li>Geopolitics</li>
</ul>

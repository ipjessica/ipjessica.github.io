<h4>Interdisciplinary Technologist</h4>
<img src="/assets/images/9.jpg" alt="headshot" width="200" height="40"/>
<p>As a former professional athlete and technologist who has cultivated interests across various disciplines that I find intellectually stimulating, the throughline has been seeking a human-centric element in the interactions we have with technology, whether that is "technology" in its classic definition, or technology that is more interwoven with our lives without conscious awareness: the technology of infrastructure, of textiles, of culture. A sideline to that throughline is that I believe there is always nuance and that care must be taken to interpret every discussion through the lens of nuance. As Walt Whitman <a href="https://iwp.uiowa.edu/whitmanweb/en/writings/song-of-myself/section-51#:~:text=What%20are%20arguably%20Whitman's%20most,adored%20by%20little%20statesmen%20and">said</a>:</p>
<ul>
<p>Do I contradict myself?<br>
Very well then I contradict myself,<br>
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)</p>
</ul>
<p>I am passionate about solving problems using my innate curiosity and desire for growth by applying in-depth research and critical thinking to understand comprehensively the areas that interest me:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fashion and Textiles</li>
    <li>Technology - distributed/decentralized computing</li>
    <li>Materials Science</li>
    <li>History</li>
    <li>Photography</li>
    <li>Computational Thinking</li>
    <li>Philosophy, Computational Theory of Mind</li>
    <li>Sports Psychology</li>
    <li>Geopolitics</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that we should look upon everything with a critical eye. As Susan Sontag alluded to across her various works (see "Against Interpretation" and "On Photography"), her view on criticism is one where the focus should be on an ontological level rather than an epistemological one. Traditional criticism often prioritizes the questioning of knowledge, of how a work can be interpreted (i.e., epistemological). However, Sontag believed in the importance of considering how the work was created, as well as the existence of the work itself, its essence and its impact on the viewer (i.e., ontological). This allows critics to search deeper into the emotions and elegance of the work that goes beyond mere intepretation.
Sontag's works are reflective of our role as critics in society and the ways in which we engage with culture at large.</p>
